Date: August 2013
Download count: 6,000+
A plugin for Minecraft on Bukkit servers. This plugin makes chickens retaliate against mean players, having them act like chickens from Legend of Zelda. The chickens will track the player in a similar way to zombies and will deal damage. They dissapear when the player dies or quits the game. These chickens will not drop any meat to prevent players from cheating and getting more chicken than usual.
